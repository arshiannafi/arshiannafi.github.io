  </figure>
  <p>This is a story of me running into a roadblock caused by external limitations. And how the roadblock pushed me to be creative in a way that I did not know was possible.</p>
  <p>So it began with a photography challenge in which I was participating at the time. The goal of the challenge was to daily capture and share a photo from a predefined list of topics.</p>
  <p>On one of those days the topic was “cloud”. I thought to myself: “This should be easy. Just go outside and capture a photo of the sky”. Right? But unfortunately, the skies were clear the entire day; not a single cloud in sight.</p>
  <p>Morning turned into noon and noon turned into afternoon; still no sign of a cloud. As time is running out, I start to think of ways to complete the day’s challenge. Then, inspiration hit me. I decided to craft a paper cutout resembling a cloud and hold it against the sky.</p>
  <p>And that is how I completed the challenge of that day. And how deadlines and constraints pushed me to think outside of the box. This photo is one of the most creative photos that I captured in my personal journey and experience.</p>
