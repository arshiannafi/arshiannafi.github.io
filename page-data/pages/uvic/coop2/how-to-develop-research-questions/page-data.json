Specifically, highlights on how to develop research\nquestions.</p>\n<h1>Highlights</h1>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The classification of research questions we use in this section is\nadapted from Meltzoff (1998)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>One of the first steps in choosing an appropriate research method is\nto clarify the research question.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>In the early stages of a research program, we usually need to ask\nexploratory questions, as we attempt to understand the phenomena,\nand identify useful distinctions that clarify our understanding.\nSuitable research methods for exploratory questions tend to be\nthose that offer rich, qualitative data, which help us to build\ntentative theories. Unless [we] are building on existing work that\nalready offers clear definitions, [we] need to formulate\nexploratory questions, such as:</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Existence questions</strong> of the form, \"Does X exist?\"</li>\n<li><strong>Description and Classification questions</strong> such as, \"What is X\nlike?\", \"What are its properties?\", \"How can it be categorized?\",\n\"How can we measure it?\", \"What is its purpose?\", \"What are its\ncomponents?\", \"How do the components relate to one another?\", and\n\"What are all the types of X?\"</li>\n<li><strong>Descriptive-Comparative questions</strong> of the form, \"How does X\ndiffer from Y?\" investigate similarities and differences between\ntwo or more phenomena.</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<p>When starting a research project, we should always begin by\nreviewing the literature (lit review)\nto see what prior work and studies are done on this topic.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>It is possible that there are already good answers\nto these questions in the published literature. [We] must\nstill ask these questions. But a literature survey, instead of\nan empirical study, may answer them.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Once we have a clearer understanding of the phenomena, we may need to\nask base-rate questions about the normal patterns of occurrence of the\nphenomena. If we fail to ask base-rate questions, then we have\nno basis for saying whether a particular situation is normal or\nunusual. Example base-rate questions include:</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Frequency and distribution questions</strong> such as, \"How often does X\noccur?\" and, \"What is an average amount of X?\" Often, these\nquestions can be answered in terms of a standard distribution\nof a characteristic within a well-defined population.</li>\n<li><strong>Descriptive-Process questions</strong> of the form, \"How does X normally\nwork?\", \"What is the process by which X happens?\", \"In what\nsequence do the events of X occur?\", \"What are the steps X goes\nthrough as it evolves?\", \"How does X achieve its purpose?\".</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Often, we are interested in the relationship between two different\nphenomena, and specifically whether occurrence of one is related to\noccurrence of the other. Hence we need to formulate some:</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Relationship questions</strong> such as, \"Are X and Y related?\" and, \"Do\noccurrences of X correlate with the occurrences of Y?\"</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Once we have established that a relationship exists between two\nphenomena, it is natural to try to explain why the relationship\nholds by attempting to identify a cause and effect. It is a common\nmistake to confuse correlation with causality. In general it is\nmuch harder to demonstrate causality than to show that two\nvariables are correlated. If high values of X correlate with\nhigh values of Y, it may be because X causes Y, or because Y\ncauses X. But it is also possible that X and Y share some common\ncause and neither causes the other. Or perhaps they co-evolve in\ncomplex ways so that there is no clear cause-and-effect.\nCausality questions include:</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Causality questions</strong> of the form, \"Does X cause Y?\" and \"Does X\nprevent Y?\" Plus the more general forms: \"What causes Y?\", \"What\nare all the factors that cause Y?\", \"What effect does X have\non Y?\" In software engineering we often ask whether using a\nparticular tool or technique causes an improvement in quality,\nspeed, and so on.</li>\n<li><strong>Causality-Comparative questions</strong> investigate relationships\nbetween different causes: \"Does X cause more Y than does Z?\"\nor, \"Is X better at preventing Y than is Z?\"</li>\n<li><strong>Causality-Comparative Interaction</strong> questions investigate how\ncontext affects a causeâ€“effect relationship: \"Does X or Z cause\nmore Y under one condition but not others?\"</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The classes of research question above are all knowledge\nquestions focused on the way the world is. Empirical\nresearch in software engineering addresses these types\nof questions. In contrast, most non-empirical research\nin software engineering focuses on a very different type\nof question concerned with designing better ways to do\nsoftware engineering (Simon, 1996):</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Design questions</strong> of the form, \"What's an effective way to\nachieve X?\" or, \"What strategies help to achieve X?\"</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>These types of question are necessary when the goal is to\ndesign better procedures and tools for carrying out some\nactivity or to design suitable social or regulatory policies.\nSuch questions presuppose that the associated knowledge\nquestions have already been addressed so that we have enough\ninformation about the nature of the design problem to be\nsolved. In practice, a long term software engineering\nresearch program involves a mix of design questions and\nknowledge questions as the researchers investigate specific\nproblems, how best to solve them, and which solutions\nwork best (Wieringa and Heerkens, 2006).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h1>Other Highlights</h1>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Because of the importance of human activities in software development,\nmany of the research methods that are appropriate to software\nengineering are drawn from disciplines that study human behaviour,\nboth at the individual level (e.g. psychology) and at the team and\norganizational levels (e.g. sociology).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h1>Work cited</h1>\n<p>S.
